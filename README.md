# workday-planner

This application employs the use of a global clock powered by Moment js in order to create a daily planner app for people to use during their workday.

The app works by ensuring the user is able to update the planner with their plans during each hour of the work day.

After the user has written their plans for that hour they are able to click the disk image on the page to save the plan and the text will save to local storage on their machine.

The planner also has the ability to switch to a 24 hour schedule should the user prefer.
